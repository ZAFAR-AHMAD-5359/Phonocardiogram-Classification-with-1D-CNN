Implementation of the paper ["Phonocardiogram classification based on 1D CNN with pitch-shifting and signal uniformity techniques"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=D5W9TVwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=D5W9TVwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) presented at EUSPICO 2024.

## Abstract

This repository contains the official implementation of our phonocardiogram (PCG) classification algorithm using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks. The method incorporates novel pitch-shifting and signal uniformity techniques to enhance classification accuracy for heart sound recordings.

## Features

- 1D CNN architecture optimized for PCG classification
- Innovative pitch-shifting data augmentation
- Signal uniformity preprocessing techniques
- Performance evaluation against state-of-the-art methods
- Visualization tools for results interpretation
